# Weakly Supervised Shortcut Learning Mitigation Using Sparse AutoEncoders
Code and data for the paper "Weakly Supervised Shortcut Learning Mitigation Using Sparse AutoEncoders". Find the [full paper + appendix here](https://github.com/Arsu-Lab/Weakly-Supervised-Shortcut-Mitigation-Sparse-AutoEncoders/blob/main/Full_paper_SAE_shortcut_mitigation.pdf).

The repository is organized into model-specific directories.  
Each folder (e.g., `ResNet_on_ISIC/`) contains:

- training scripts  
- testing/evaluation scripts when sparse muting applied
- utility functions used in the experiments

We have also uploaded the **metadata files** used in our experiments like Split-Metadata_WB for WaterBirds dataset and Split-Metadata_ISIC for ISIC dataset.  
These files provide the labels and additional information required to fully reproduce our results.
